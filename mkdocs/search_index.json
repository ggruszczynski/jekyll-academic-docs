It is a template for \nJekyll\n, a static website generator. It's features include the ability to create blog posts, a dedicated resume page, social media integration and the ability to create and host \nReveal.js\n presentations. It is also designed to be hosted on GitHub pages. Jekyll Academic allows you to create a well designed, functional and completely free website. Hosting on GitHub pages allows you to keep the website in one place, even if you move between institutions.\n\n\nWhat is a Static Website?\n\n\nStatic websites are websites that do not require a database to store and deliver content to site visitors. In some ways static websites are more similar to early websites in that they rely primarily upon HTML and CSS to serve rather simple content to visitors. However, do not let the simplicity imply that they are somehow inferior to a dynamic website option such as WordPress.\n\n\nStatic websites have many advantages over dynamic websites. They are relatively simple to maintain, fast to load and incredibly secure. By creating a website that is not overly reliant upon third party software platforms you remain in total control of your content. You know exactly where every file for the website is, and do not have to worry about your content becoming trapped in a proprietary system or database.\n\n\nWhat is a Static Website Generator?\n\n\nA static website generator is a tool that takes flat files and processes them into the necessary HTML and CSS files to become a website. In the case of Jekyll Academic the majority of the files are written using the Markdown markup language. It is a simplified text markup language that allows you to mimic the features of HTML without needing to know HTML. Jekll is built using the Ruby programming language, it can take the Markdown and sass files that are in the Jekyll Academic directory and process those files, creating a fully functioning website.\n\n\nIs This the Right Type of Site for Me?\n\n\nWhile there are many advantages of using a static website generator to create your professional academic website, it may not be the right tool for everyone. This type of website is best suited for websites consisting mainly of static text content. If you need a site that relies heavily on video and large image galleries this may not be the best option for you. If you are looking for a site to host a CV and showcase some presentations as well as some text based pages (blog or otherwise) it will likely suit your needs.",

If you wish to host the site elsewhere, or wish to unlock more powerful features available in Jekyll you may want to consider a local Jekyll installation as well. More detailed instructions can be found on the \nAdvanced Features\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Setup\n\n\nConnect your GitHub Repository to GitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nDownload GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com/ (skip this step if you already have GitHub Desktop installed)\n\n\nDouble-click on downloaded file to begin the installation\n\n\nWhile on the Welcome screen click on Continue\n\n\nSign in using your GitHub username and password\n\n\nClick Sign In\n\n\nClick Continue\n\n\nClick Continue one more time\n\n\nClick on the plus sign in the upper left-hand corner of the screen to add a repository to Github Desktop\n\n\nClick Clone\n\n\nFind the \n[username].github.io\n repository you created earlier and click Clone Repository\n\n\nSelect the location where you would like to save the local copy of the files from your repository (e.g. Documents)\n\n\nOnce the clone is finished you can click on the name of the repository on the left-hand side of Github Desktop to see any uncommitted changes (there shouldn\u2019t be any yet)\n\n\n\n\nEdit File, Sync Changes\n\n\n\n\nMake changes to one of your website's pages that is now saved in your local filesystem (ex. open resume.md using a text editor and update the information in the file)\n\n\nSave the file you edited\n\n\nOpen GitHub Desktop\n\n\nClick to see Uncommitted Changes (at the top center portion of the screen)\n\n\nAdd commit message to the summary field that says what changes you made\n\n\nClick Commit to Master\n\n\nClick Sync\n\n\nRefresh the browser window with your website ([username].github.io) and check for changes on the page you edited\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Files and Folders\n\n\nIn order to better understand how everything in your site works, there are a few files and folders that you need to be aware of. These files control the main elements of your site, including your logo, bio photo and navigation. Full documentation of the directory structure can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_config.yml\n - This is your websites main configuration file. It allows you to set a site title, links to your social media accounts as well as a logo and bio photo image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccent.scss\n - This file is used to set the colors of your site. The site is set up to accept two colors (highlight, lowlight). The main impact of the color choice  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_posts\n - This folder holds all of the posts and presentations for your website. There is one sample post file and one sample presentation file located in this directory by default. The easiest way to create a new post or presentation is to simply copy either the post or presentation file and edit the contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimages/bio-photo.jpg\n - This is the photo that appears on the home page of the website. The recommended image size is 200px x 200px.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimages/logo.png\n - If you wish to use a logo for your site, include logo.png in the images folder. You will also need to add logo.png under the 'Logo:' section of the _config.yml file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_data/navigation.yml\n -This is the file that allows you to manage your navigation elements. By default all available navigation items are shown. If you wish to hide any items, simply delete them from this file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Blog posts\n\n\nTo add a new blog post to your site you simply create a new Markdown file by either copying another post file and editing the contents or starting with a blank markdown file. Keep in mind that \nJekyll requires that all posts follow the yyyy-mm-dd-title.md naming convention.\n\n\nIf you wish to begin with a blank markdown file, you must paste the following YAML front matter at the very beginning of your file.\n\n\n---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Add Your Title Here\nexcerpt: \"Add an excerpt here, the excerpt will appear underneath the blog title\"\nmodified: 2016-01-13 20:41:38\ntags: [intro, beginner, jekyll, tutorial]\ncomments: true\ncategory: blog\n---\n\n\n\nThe important thing to note is that you need to make sure that the category is set to 'blog'. This ensures that this post will appear on the blog page. You can then add your blog content using Markdown as your markup language for the rest of the file.\n\n\nAdding Reveal.js Presentations\n\n\nIn Jekyll Academic presentations are actually set up as posts, and live in the same _posts folder as your blog posts. They also must use the same file naming convention as posts (yyyy-mm-dd-title.md). The main difference between a blog post and a Reveal.js presentation is the layout and category used in the YAML front matter.\n\n\nIf you wish to begin your Reveal.js presentation with a blank markdown file, you must paste the following YAML front matter at the very beginning of your file.\n\n\n---\nlayout: slide\ntitle: Add Your Title Here\nexcerpt: \"Add an excerpt here, the excerpt will appear underneath the blog title\"\nmodified: 2016-01-13 20:41:38\ntags: [intro, beginner, jekyll, tutorial]\ncomments: true\ncategory: presentation\n---\n\nsection data-markdown\n\n# Add Reveal.js slide content here, following the Reveal.js format\n\n/section\n\n\n\n\nNote that Reveal.js presentations must use \"slide\" as the layout and \"presentation\" as the category.\n\n\nAdding Links to External Presentations\n\n\nIf you would rather use another service, like Google Presentations for your presentations you can still link to them from your Jekyll Academic website. To do so start a new file in your _posts directory following the same yyyy-mm-dd-title.md file name convention and paste the following YAML front matter into that file.\n\n\n  ---\n  layout: post\n  title: Add Your Title Here\n  excerpt: \"Add an excerpt here, the excerpt will appear underneath the blog title\"\n  modified: 2016-01-13 20:41:38\n  tags: [intro, beginner, jekyll, tutorial]\n  comments: true\n  category: presentation\n  ---\n  # Title of Presentation\n  ## SubTitle of Presentation\n  [Text for Link](html link to presentation)\n\n\n\nIn the above example you are using the 'post' layout, but giving it a 'presentation' category. This means it will give you a blank post page, but will appear under your list of presentations. The content on this page can be anything, but you will need to at least add a link to wherever your presentation is located.\n\n\n\n\nAdding or Removing Navigation Items\n\n\nYou may want to add additional navigation items that point to different types of content or individual pages. This can be accomplished by adding a new navigation item. In order to add a new navigation item you will:\n\n\n1) Copy the folder of an existing navigation item (e.g resume) and paste it into the root directory of your project. Rename this folder with the name of the new navigation item.\n\n\n2) Navigate to _data/navigation.yml and add a new navigation item by copying the layout of an existing navigation item.\n\n\n3) Take a look at some of the existing index.md files for other navigation items. Take note of the 'layout' element declared in the frontmatter. This will help you determine which layout is appropriate for your newly created page (e.g. Page or Resume)\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Layouts\n\n\nOne of the fundamental elements of Jekyll is the ability to utilize different layouts for different types of pages. The layouts are found in the _layouts folder. These are .html files that drive the layout of any particular page. For example the 'slide' layout contains all of the necessary includes to power Reveal.js slides. The current available layouts in Jekyll Academic are:\n\n\n\n\nhome - This layout is the layout for the homepage of your website. It automatically includes your 5 most recent blog posts in the space to the right of the social media section.\n\n\npage - This layout is used for any individual page, like the 'About Me' page. It is a blank page that can be formatted using Markdown.\n\n\npost-index - This layout is used on the blog archive. It lists every blog post chronologically separated by year.\n\n\npost - This layout is used for blog posts. It includes a few more functionality elements than the 'page' layout.\n\n\nresume - This layout is used for the Resume page.\n\n\npresentation-post-index - This layout is identical to the post-index layout except it is used on the presentations index to post all presentations you have on your site in one location, chronologically.\nslide - This layout is used for creating a Reveal.js slide deck.",

These files control the main elements of your site, including your logo, bio photo and navigation. Full documentation of the directory structure can be found  here .    _config.yml  - This is your websites main configuration file. It allows you to set a site title, links to your social media accounts as well as a logo and bio photo image.    accent.scss  - This file is used to set the colors of your site. The site is set up to accept two colors (highlight, lowlight). The main impact of the color choice      _posts  - This folder holds all of the posts and presentations for your website. There is one sample post file and one sample presentation file located in this directory by default. The easiest way to create a new post or presentation is to simply copy either the post or presentation file and edit the contents.    images/bio-photo.jpg  - This is the photo that appears on the home page of the website. The recommended image size is 200px x 200px.    images/logo.png  - If you wish to use a logo for your site, include logo.png in the images folder. You will also need to add logo.png under the 'Logo:' section of the _config.yml file.    _data/navigation.yml  -This is the file that allows you to manage your navigation elements.

The current available layouts in Jekyll Academic are:   home - This layout is the layout for the homepage of your website. It automatically includes your 5 most recent blog posts in the space to the right of the social media section.  page - This layout is used for any individual page, like the 'About Me' page. It is a blank page that can be formatted using Markdown.  post-index - This layout is used on the blog archive. It lists every blog post chronologically separated by year.  post - This layout is used for blog posts. It includes a few more functionality elements than the 'page' layout.  resume - This layout is used for the Resume page.  presentation-post-index - This layout is identical to the post-index layout except it is used on the presentations index to post all presentations you have on your site in one location, chronologically.\nslide - This layout is used for creating a Reveal.js slide deck.",

The integration with GitHub Pages allows you to fully set up Jekyll Academic without ever installing Jekyll locally. However, many users may wish to make advanced modifications to their site. If you wish to do so, you would benefit from installing Jekyll locally. The following instructions are based on using Mac OSX as your operating system.\n\n\nSetting Up Jekyll Locally\n\n\nGitHub Pages has been designed to work with Jekyll allowing you to upload your 'raw' site files and have GitHub interpret them and create your site. This works well for any user that wants to use GitHub Pages. However, there are additional features that can be utilized if you wish to install Jekyll locally. Local installation allows you to preview the changes made to your site without committing them to GitHub. It also allows you to create new posts from the command line.\n\n\nTo set up Jekyll locally you will need to install the following three things:\n\n\n\n\nRuby\n\n\nRubyGems\n\n\nJekyll\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Ruby\n\n\nProbably the easiest way to install Ruby on a Mac is using \nHomebrew\n. Once you have Homebrew installed you can install ruby using the command \nbrew install ruby\n. If you are using another operating system, or wish to have a more advanced ruby setup, you may find the instructions listed \nhere\n useful. After installing ruby on your system you will need to install \nRubyGems\n this can be completed by following the instructions on the \nRubyGems\n website.\n\n\nInstalling Jekyll\n\n\nJekyll can be installed using RubyGems once you have ruby and RubyGems installed you can install Jekyll using the command \ngem install jekyll\n.\n\n\nUsing Jekyll Locally\n\n\nJekyll is an incredibly powerful tool. It also has a ton of great documentation written about it already that can be found at the \nJekyll\n website. We highly recommend you take a look at that site to get a better idea of the advanced features that are available. Two of the most common Jekyll commands are described below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJekyll Serve\n - The primary advantage of installing Jekyll locally is that it allows you to make updates to your site and preview those changes before pushing them to GitHub. In order to view changes that you are making to your site in a preview development server run \njekyll serve\n from your project directory and then navigate to http://localhost:4000/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJekyll Build\n - If you wish to host your website somewhere other than GitHub Pages it will require that you create a site folder containing valid HTML and CSS files. You can do this by running \njekyll build\n from the root folder of your project directory. That will result in the creation of a _site folder. That folder can then be uploaded to the webhost of your choosing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Structure\n\n\nWe have provided a rudimentary file tree to help you navigate the basic file structure of your site. It is broken down into three risk levels (low, medium, high).\n\n\n\n\nLow risk\n files are ones that you will need to edit in order to update the basic text on your site, but editing them will not cause any damage to site functionality.\n\n\nMedium risk\n files contain HTML layout files and CSS files. You may find a need to edit these files to update the look and layout of your site. However, this is considered a more advanced task, breaking these files could cause your site layout to break.\n\n\nHigh risk\n files are the files used by Jekyll to provide basic functionality to the site, it is unlikely that you will need to edit these files, and doing so could cause your site to stop functioning.\n\n\n\n\n      ---------------------------------------------------\n      Low Risk:\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.md\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 resume.md\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 _config.yml\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 accent.scss\n      |\n      |\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 _posts\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 2016-07-22-example-presentation.md\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 2016-07-23-example-post.md\n      |\n      |\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 images\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bio-photo.jpg\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 logo.png\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 _data\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 navigation.yml\n      ---------------------------------------------------\n      Medium Risk:\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 _sass\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 _includes\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _author-bio.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _browser-upgrade.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _cvhead.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _disqus_comments.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _feed-footer.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _footer.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _head.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _navigation.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _open-graph.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _scripts.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 _social-share.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 _toc.html\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 _layouts\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 home.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 page.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 post-index.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 post.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 presentation-post-index.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 resume.html\n      \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 slide.html\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets\u00a0\n      \u2502\u00a0\n      ---------------------------------------------------\n      High Risk:\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 favicon.png\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 presentations.md\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 blog.md\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 404.md\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 Gemfile\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 Gemfile.lock\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 Gruntfile.js\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md",

The first section is taught entirely in a web browser, so no additional installation of software is required. Section two of the workshop requires the installation of Github Desktop as well as a text editor. Section three of the workshop is more of an in-depth discussion of additional ways to take advantage of advanced features in Jekyll, Github and with the Jekyll Academic theme.  \n\n\nPutting on a Workshop\n\n\nWorkshop Materials\n\n\nWe have published a set of workshop materials that you are free to use, should you choose to teach this workshop.
